# Cubic Spline Interpolation

Cubic spline interpolation is a technique for generating a twice differential spline connecting a given set of points. The spline itself is a piecewise function consisting of segments of cubic functions.

The functions are generated by solving a system of equations generated by the restrictions tht are placed on the functions.
